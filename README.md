# Java/Android Card Games Compendium

## Overview:

Compendium is a mobile game application produced using Java and Android. Using the Java language to model the logic for the
games,and the Android IDE as the development environment, it allows the user to play two card games, the High/Low Card Game
and also a simplified version of Blackjack. The High/Low card game deals a hand of two cards randomly to two players, compares
the hand values and decides on the winner. The Blackjack game features a simplified version of the full game played in casinos. Players play against the dealer, and take cards until they either Stand (cease taking further cards) or Bust (exceed 21 in hand value).

## Project Brief:

Goal: Create a card game in Android.

2 weeks ago you were assigned a lab to create a high/low card game using objects modelled in Java. You are now being asked to take that Java code and use it as the basis for an Android app which plays the same game of cards.

HINT Think of the lessons where we wrote regular Java classes in Android Studio, ran unit tests on them, and then used them in our Eight Ball app.

## MVP:

The game does not need to have much or any interaction. The aim is to display the results of the Java logic already written. For example, if you had two players being dealt two cards each your screen might look something like:

  Player 1: Ace of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds
  Player 2: 3 of Clubs, 2 of Hearts

  Player 1 Wins!
  
## Project Extensions:

* Possibly add another card game
* Improve the UI

## To Run the Application:

A user may clone the repository to a local network folder using the 'git clone' command:

* Navigate to a local network folder using Terminal.
* Execute the Terminal command: 'git clone git@github.com:Alexhub88/cc_wk9_project_cardgame.git' in that folder.
* Open Android Studio.
* Select 'Open an existing Android Studio project'.
* Using the browser in Android Studio, navigate to the 'Final' folder one level below the 'cc_wk9_project_cardgame' folder.
* Click 'Open'.
* Once the project has opened, click the 'Play' button at the top of the central menu bar.
* The mobile emulator will start and the Compendium opening screen will appear.
* Use the menu in the top right to select which game to play: the High/Low Game or Blackjack.
