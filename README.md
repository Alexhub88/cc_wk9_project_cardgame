# Java/Android Games Compendium

Compendium is a mobile game application produced using Java and Android. Using the Java language to model the logic for the
games,and the Android IDE as the development environment, it allows the user to play two card games, the High/Low Card Game
and also a simplified version of Blackjack. The High/Low card game deals a hand of two cards randomly to two players, compares
the hand values and decides on the winner. The Blackjack game features a simplified version of the full game played in casinos.
Players play against the dealer, and take cards until they either Stand (cease taking further cards) or Bust (exceed 21 in 
hand value).
